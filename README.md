# Struct-Stundets-in-C-
Here I have a code in C++ with a struct function and cases to manage a menu for the students. We have to options to add, delete, show all students, modify, calculate their mean of grades and exit on the main page. For each student we add the first and last name, their unique number called "numar matricol",university profile, phone number, year and mean of grades.
